 The result of `DIVIDEND / DIVISOR` (division). Contents undefined while CSR_READY is low.  
 For signed calculations, QUOTIENT is negative when the signs of DIVIDEND and DIVISOR differ.  
 This register can be written to directly, for context save/restore purposes. This halts any  
 in-progress calculation and sets the CSR_READY and CSR_DIRTY flags.  
 Reading from QUOTIENT clears the CSR_DIRTY flag, so should read results in the order  
 REMAINDER, QUOTIENT if CSR_DIRTY is used.  

You can [`read`](crate::generic::Reg::read) this register and get [`div_quotient::R`](R).
